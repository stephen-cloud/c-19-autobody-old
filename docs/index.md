Here is the full documentation for creating the C-19 Autobody sample application in TBD.

Why C-19 Autobody? Well, I was laid off from my company as a result of COVID-19. Sales being down. A lot. So between talking to recruiters and having interviews, I learned lots of things I didn't know and put them together. 

Here's are the features and technologies we're using to implement them.

| Feature | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| A type safe(r) programming language | TypeScript |
| A User Interface | React Material |
| Sign-up, sign-in, forgot password | AWS Amplify Authentication |
| A back-end API | GraphQL schema definition + AWS Amplify GraphQL API |
| A database | AWS Amplify API + AWS DynamoDB |
| Subscribe to data changes; handle off-line edits | AWS AppSync | 

## The upshot

After you follow all the steps, you'll have a React Material web application backed by a GraphQL backend in AWS. The application manages the basics of an Autobody shop

 - ... TDB

The application is only a demo: It doesn't actually fix cars.
